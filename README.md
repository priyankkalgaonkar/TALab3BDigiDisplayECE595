# Lab 3 - Grove 4-Digit Display Experiment 
## Introduction
Grove 4-Digit Display module is a 12-pin module. In this module, a TM1637 is used to scale down the number of controlling pins to 2. That is to say, it controls both the content and the luminance via only 2 digital pins. Grove 4 Digit Display uses TM1637 to control 4 seven-segment display with two pin (clk, dio) interface.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).
